- Linting: [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) pinpoints issues in your CSS. Take the warnings as suggestions on how to improve your CSS. 
- Find unused CSS: [Chrome DevTools Audit Panel](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#audits)  can analyze a page as it loads. Then provides suggestions and optimizations for decreasing page load time and increase perceived (and real) responsiveness. [Dust-Me Selectors](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dust-me-selectors/) is an add-on for Firebug in Firefox that finds unused selectors.
- Survey what CSS rules you have: [CSS Dig](http://cssdig.com/) is an automated script that runs through all of your code to help you see it visually. A similar tool is [StyleStats](http://www.stylestats.org/) and [CSSStats](http://cssstats.com/), where you type in a url to survey its CSS.
