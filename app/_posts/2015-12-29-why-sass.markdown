<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>o you ever weep, first with bewilderment, then frustration when you are asked to work on a newly discovered legacy project, and then ask yourself,  “How the !@#$ do you maintain this?!”?</p>

See: [*Why Sass?* - Dan Cederholm](http://alistapart.com/article/why-sass)

Ever needed to change, say, a color in your stylesheet, and found that you had to find and replace the value multiple times? Don’t you wish CSS allowed you to do this?

{% highlight css %}
$brand-color: #fc3;

a {
  color: $brand-color;
}

nav {
  background-color: $brand-color;
}
{% endhighlight %}

What if you could change that value in one place and the entire stylesheet reflected that change? You can with Sass!

Or how about repeated blocks of styles that are used in various locations throughout the stylesheet?

{% highlight css %}
p {
  margin-bottom: 20px; 
  font-size: 14px; 
  line-height: 1.5;
}

footer {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Wouldn’t it be fantastic to roll those shared rules into a reusable block? Again, defined only once but included wherever you needed them.

{% highlight sass %}
@mixin default-type {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
  @include default-type;
}

footer {
  @include default-type;
}
{% endhighlight %}

That’s Sass! And those two extremely simple examples barely scratch the surface as to how Sass makes authoring stylesheets faster, easier, and more flexible. It’s a welcome helper in the world of web design, because anyone that’s created a website knows that CSS is hard, and hard to maintain.
